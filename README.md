Projects that require rapid releases and iterative development are referred to as time-sensitive projects.
Creating an MVP for a new product is one example.

Waterfall is better suited for projects with stable, well-defined requirements, where the project's scope is predetermined.
For instance, construction projects have predetermined specifications, such as constructing a bridge.
Regulated Industries: Those that require stringent documentation and adherence to regulations.
For instance, creating medical gadgets requires precise specifications and regulatory clearance.
Projects that are predictable have duties and results that are clearly known.
For instance, government infrastructure initiatives such as building new roads.


## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
Techniques for Assuring Software Project Quality Assurance (QA):
Automated Testing: To identify problems early, use regression, integration, and unit tests.
Code Reviews: Examine code frequently for mistakes, functionality, and compliance with best practices.
Continuous Integration (CI): To swiftly identify problems, use CI tools to automatically build and test code with each change.
Manual Testing: To make sure the program satisfies user demands, carry out exploratory and user acceptance testing (UAT).
Test-Driven Development (TDD): To make sure all functionality is verified, write tests before writing code.
Test the software's performance and load to make sure it works well under various stressors and loads.

Why It's Critical to Uphold High Standards:
Customer satisfaction: Better user experiences and expectations are guaranteed by high-quality software.
Lower Costs: The cost of resolving problems later in the project is decreased when flaws are discovered early.
Reliability and Security: Guarantees that the program is reliable, safe, and effective in practical applications.
Long-Term Success: High-quality software is simpler to scale, maintain, and modify, which reduces the likelihood of problems down the road.


## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
Project scope definition establishes boundaries, helps align stakeholder expectations, and guarantees clarity on what the project will achieve. By outlining objectives, deliverables, schedules, and resources, it helps to improve project control, focus, and decision-making while avoiding scope creep.

The project is broken down hierarchically into smaller, more manageable tasks or work packages using a work breakdown structure, or WBS. The project as a whole is broken down into deliverables and sub-deliverables.

The Benefits of WBS
Organizes Tasks: Assists in decomposing intricate jobs into manageable chunks.
Enhances Planning: Offers a framework for resource, time, and cost estimation.
Tracks Progress: By calculating the completion of each task, this tool aids in tracking the progress of a project.
